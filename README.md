# ContractMap
Prototype for a government contract discovery site that aggregates listings
from CivCast, Bonfire, and SAM.gov into a Zillow-style map view.

## What this includes
- Interactive map powered by Leaflet + OpenStreetMap tiles
- Filterable list of opportunities with value, due date, and contact info
- Sample data that can be swapped for live feeds

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser. No build step or dependencies required.

## Next steps
Replace `contractData` in `app.js` with live data ingestion and add
authentication + billing to support the $20/month subscription idea.
